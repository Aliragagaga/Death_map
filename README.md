# Do I Win Yet?
Simple command line python program based on the popular MOBA, League of Legends.
The program asks the user for a summoner name, and based on the statistics from the last n games, creates a logistic regression model that classifies a win/loss based on the statistics. The program will then return exact metrics on what sort of game performance is required for that specific summoner to win a game.
